An Android App which allows users to create location based tasks, which can be completed by scanning NFC tags at the respective places.

The server side of the app can be found here: https://github.com/cmnd97/Moneyvate_Server

The app is currently a work in progress. 
As the name suggests, this app is supposed to work with money, in order to motivate users into completing their tasks. This feature
will be powered by paypal and will be added later. 

Until then, one can use the app as it is, but a running server is required for the app to function, as every action is sent to
the server. 
If you want to try out the app and the server is offline, feel free to contact me!
